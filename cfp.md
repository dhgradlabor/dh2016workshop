Does your library or digital humanities center employ graduate students? Are you considering employing graduate students in digital scholarship work at your university? This full-day workshop will bring together institutions that do to discuss the variety of institutional arrangements for employing graduate students in digital scholarship labor. If graduate students can help build capacity for digital work on your campus, what are some best practices for structuring their employment? What are some current models in place, and what are the benefits and challenges of fellowships vs. part time employment or RAships? We want this workshop to present helpful practical advice on this topic, but also serve as a starting point for a broader discussion about the place of student labor in DH work. We hope to include perspectives of diverse stakeholders (faculty, graduate students, librarians, archivists, instructional technologists, IT professionals, program directors, etc.) to address the range of possibilities at different types of institutions. 

We welcome applications/proposals from anyone interested in:

* attending as a workshop participant
* contributing as a discussion leader
* presenting a short paper or talk (500-2000 words)

Those interested should submit a short narrative (no more than 500 words) of your experience working with graduate students (or as a graduate student) on digital humanities projects, programs, or initiatives by **May 15** via the [**Submission Form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1kP-YoRVFUpZl22NfB1yQ5e0DPeMb1yYSpS90_tZn4_w/viewform). Please also note how you would like to contribute to the workshop (as participant, discussion leader, or presenter) and in which of the themes (provide a first and second choice if applicable). Themes include: 

* defining graduate student work in DH 
* models for structuring this work
* making the work meaningful
* building capacity through graduate student labor
* expectations of institutions, supervisors, and/or students
* funding, resources, and support

We encourage proposals offering perspectives from outside the U.S. The six workshop organizers, along with Zoe Borovsky of the DH and Libraries SIG, will serve as the program committee. We will notify participants of their application status no later than May 30, 2016.
