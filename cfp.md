Does your library or digital humanities center employ graduate students? Are you considering employing graduate students in digital scholarship work at your university? This full-day workshop will bring together institutions that do to discuss the variety of institutional arrangements for employing graduate students in digital scholarship labor. If graduate students can help build capacity for digital work on your campus, what are some best practices for structuring their employment? What are some current models in place, and what are the benefits and challenges of fellowships vs. part time employment or RAships? We want this workshop to present helpful practical advice on this topic, but also serve as a starting point for a broader discussion about the place of student labor in DH work. We hope to include perspectives of diverse stakeholders (faculty, graduate students, librarians, archivists, instructional technologists, IT professionals, program directors, etc.) to address the range of possibilities at different types of institutions. 

Those who are interested should send a ~500 word narrative of your experience working with graduate students (or as a graduate student) on digital humanities projects, programs, or initiatives to [dh2016workshop@gmail.com](mailto:dh2016workshop@gmail.com) by March 31. Please also note how you would like to contribute to the workshop (as participant or facilitator) and in which of the themes (provide a first and second choice if applicable). We encourage proposals offering perspectives from outside the U.S. The six workshop leaders listed on the proposal and Zoe Borovsky of the DH and Libraries SIG will serve as the program committee, and will notify participants of their application status no later than April 29.
